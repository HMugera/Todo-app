# To-Do-List Using JavaScript
The user can add a to-do by filling the input and hit ENTER, there is a checkbox for every activity
and after one is done he/she can check the activity, or remove it using the delete button.

The user's to-do list is stored in the local storage, so when the user refreshes the page, he/she can always find the list there.

There is the possibility for the user, to clear the list, by clicking the button clear, at the top right corner of our app.

The to do list app, shows the today's date to the user, for that we're using a method called toLocaleDateString, 
which you can read about here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString
